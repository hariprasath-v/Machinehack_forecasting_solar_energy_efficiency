### Problem
create a model to predict solar energy efficiency based on the measurements of various meteorological parameters over a period of time.

### Evaluation
#### Evaluation metric for this competition is Mean Square Error.

### Dataset

You can download the dataset <a href="https://machinehack.com/hackathons/forecasting_solar_energy_efficiency_engage_in_the_challenge_and_win/data">here</a>    

### Solution:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
#### The basic exploratory data analysis of the data,
* Numerical Distribution Analysis
* Correlation Analysis
* Stationary Analysis
#### The above analysis had done by using,
* pandas 
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* statemodels

### Model
#### Trained each target label separately by using pycaret tool and the model was evaluated with an MSE score.
#### Final model was blended from the top 3 performing models.
